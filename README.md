# Personal_work_repo
Projects that I have worked on, to learn and to see if I can do it.
I have implemented data structures like linked lists,stack,queue,trees in object oriented style with smart pointers and templates.
Also I have written C++ programs for the most used design patterns, along with some explanatory UML diagrams.
